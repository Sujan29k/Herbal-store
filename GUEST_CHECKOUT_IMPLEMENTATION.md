# Guest Checkout Implementation

## Overview
The application now supports guest checkout functionality, allowing visitors to purchase products without creating an account.

## Changes Made

### 1. Checkout Page (`src/app/checkout/page.tsx`)
- **Removed mandatory login requirement**: Users can now proceed to checkout without being logged in
- **Enhanced form validation**: Email is now required for guest users
- **Visual indicators**: Added "Guest Checkout" badge and special styling for guest users
- **Email pre-filling**: Automatically fills email for logged-in users and disables the field
- **Guest flag**: Sends `isGuest: true` flag to the order API

### 2. Order API (`src/app/api/order/route.ts`)
- **Support for guest users**: Modified to handle orders without requiring a registered user
- **Conditional user lookup**: Only looks up users for registered customers
- **Guest email storage**: Stores guest email separately in the `guestEmail` field
- **Enhanced email notifications**: Order confirmation emails now indicate if the customer is a guest

### 3. Order Model (`src/models/Order.ts`)
- **Optional userId**: Made `userId` field optional to support guest orders
- **Guest email field**: Added `guestEmail` field to store email addresses for guest customers
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing orders with registered users continue to work

### 4. Admin Orders API (`src/app/api/admin/orders/route.ts`)
- **Unified email handling**: Returns a consistent `userEmail` field for both registered and guest users
- **Guest identification**: Adds `isGuest` flag to order objects
- **Enhanced data transformation**: Properly handles both user types in admin interface

### 5. Admin Panel (`src/app/admin/dashboard/AdminPanel.tsx`)
- **Guest user support**: Updated to display "Guest User" for non-registered customers
- **Unified display**: Uses the new `userEmail` field for consistent customer identification
- **Customer count**: Properly counts unique customers including guests

## Features

### For Customers
- ✅ **No registration required**: Can purchase products immediately
- ✅ **Simple checkout**: Just enter shipping details and email
- ✅ **Order confirmation**: Receives email notifications for order updates
- ✅ **Visual feedback**: Clear indication when checking out as a guest

### For Admins
- ✅ **Guest order tracking**: Can see all orders including guest purchases
- ✅ **Customer identification**: Clear distinction between registered and guest users
- ✅ **Email notifications**: Receives order notifications with customer type indicated

## Technical Implementation

### Order Flow
1. **Cart to Checkout**: Both logged-in and guest users can proceed to checkout
2. **Form Validation**: Email is required for guests, optional for logged-in users
3. **Order Creation**: Creates order with either `userId` (registered) or `guestEmail` (guest)
4. **Email Notification**: Sends confirmation to admin with customer type indication

### Database Schema
```typescript
// Order Model
{
  userId?: ObjectId,        // Optional - for registered users
  guestEmail?: string,      // Optional - for guest users
  items: [...],
  totalAmount: number,
  shippingDetails: {...},
  status: string
}
```

### API Response Format
```typescript
// Admin Orders API
{
  ...orderFields,
  userEmail: string,        // Unified email field
  isGuest: boolean         // Guest identification flag
}
```

## Testing
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Guest checkout flow works
- ✅ Registered user checkout still works
- ✅ Admin panel displays both user types

## Notes
- Guest users are identified by the absence of a `userId` in orders
- Email addresses are still collected for order confirmation and communication
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing registered user orders
- Admin notifications clearly distinguish between guest and registered customers
